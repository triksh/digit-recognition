# digit-recognition
Trained only for printed digits

A k-nearest neighbour (knn) implimentation using opencv 3.0 via c++

I have trained this only for printed digits. If you want hand-written digit recognition then train it using MNIST dataset

This is very useful to those who are still strugling for implementing a knn classifier in opencv 3.0
